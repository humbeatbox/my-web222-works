      <h1>Modern Folk Music</h1>
      <p>
        This folk music style differs significantly from traditional folk music in several ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Lyrics</strong>: Traditional folk music typically reflects rural life, labor
          scenes, and folk stories. In contrast, modern folk music lyrics more often reflect
          emotions, personal experiences, and social phenomena of urban life. The lyrics usually
          have a strong personal touch and poetic quality, resonating deeply with the younger
          generation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Musical Style</strong>: Traditional folk music often uses simple instruments like
          the erhu and pipa, with a plain and unadorned musical style. Modern folk music, however,
          incorporates elements of contemporary popular music, with the guitar being the primary
          accompaniment instrument. The melodies are more diverse and modern, making them more
          appealing and engaging compared to traditional folk music.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Singing Style</strong>: Traditional folk music features a straightforward and
          simple singing style, focusing on storytelling. Modern folk music places more emphasis on
          emotional expression, with a singing style that incorporates more personal emotions,
          allowing listeners to deeply feel the sentiments and atmospheres conveyed in the songs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Music Production</strong>: The use of modern technology has led to more refined
          music production and higher sound quality, which is rare in traditional folk music.
          Advances in recording techniques and production methods make this music more easily
          disseminated across various media platforms.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Overall, this folk music style maintains the simplicity of traditional folk while
        incorporating modern musical elements and personal emotions, resulting in music that is both
        traditionally grounded and contemporarily relevant.
