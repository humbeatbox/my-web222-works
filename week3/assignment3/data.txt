羅宋湯：我家媽媽的秘傳口味，超過東歐經典味道的台灣與東歐混合菜餚

羅宋湯：
又稱紅菜湯，是一道源自東歐的傳統湯品，尤以烏克蘭、俄羅斯、波蘭和立陶宛等地最為著名。
但這道湯對台灣人的意義卻不一樣，台灣喝羅宋湯的歷史來自於前總統「蔣經國」(1910-1988)，他在1925年時，
被送往俄羅斯留學，但實際上是擔任人質，以讓共產國家放心與他的父親已故前總統「蔣中正」合作，
因此他在從小就隻身被送往寒冷的俄羅斯，也是當時的配偶「Фаина Ипатьевна Вахрева」經常主羅宋湯給他喝，
即便在蔣氏政權退守溫暖的台灣後，他依然保有喝羅宋當的息慣，也因此羅宋湯不僅是一道美食，更是一種文化象徵，代表著家庭的溫暖與團聚。以下是羅宋湯的詳細介紹和製作方法。

台灣的羅宋湯不同於東歐，台灣不生產甜菜根，因此台灣並沒有將這項主要得蔬菜加入道食譜當中，而肉類則因為傳統中國會使用各類辛香料處理，因此我母親也是如此處理肉類的，融合了傳統中華民俗的肉類處理方式，加上歐系料理經常使用得義大利混合香料，將湯汁與肉類的味道襯托至不一樣得層次。


羅宋湯的食材與製作
以下是經典烏克蘭羅宋湯的詳細食材和製作步驟：
備料：
	1.製作肉類高湯：
        將肉放入大鍋中，加水覆蓋(300~500cc)並煮沸。撇去表面的浮沫後撈起。
        在大湯鍋中放如牛油，煎炒至表面金黃輕微燒焦。
        同時加入切好得洋蔥與中式香料或滷包，並轉小火煮約1.5小時，直到肉變嫩。
        （關鍵步驟）在冰箱放一個晚上，讓湯汁的味道進入肉中，並且撈起過多的油脂讓湯喝起來較為清爽不油膩。
	2.	炒馬鈴薯：
	•	將切塊的馬鈴薯切塊後在鍋子中乾煎至金黃微焦，避免後續燉湯時容易破損至湯中。
	3.	混合食材：
	•	將切好的番茄、馬鈴薯、紅蘿蔔倒入肉湯中，燉煮30分鐘後加入高麗菜。
        將湯煮沸後，然後轉小火煮至蔬菜變軟，約30~60分鐘。
	4.	最後調味：
	•	加入義式香料進行最後的調味。
	5.	上桌：
	•	熱湯盛入碗中，撒上新鮮的洋香菜和香菜。這部分遵循傳統通常可以搭配一片黑麥麵包食用。

Borscht: My mother’s secret taste, a fusion of Taiwanese and Eastern European dishes that surpasses the classic Eastern European taste

Borscht:
Also known as red cabbage soup, it is a traditional soup originating from Eastern Europe, especially in Ukraine, Russia, Poland and Lithuania.
But this soup has a different meaning to Taiwanese people. The history of drinking borscht in Taiwan comes from former president Chiang Ching-kuo (1910-1988). In 1925,
He was sent to Russia to study, but was actually used as a hostage to reassure the communist country to cooperate with his father, the late former President Chiang Kai-shek.
Therefore, he was sent to the cold Russia alone since he was a child. His spouse at the time, "Фаина Ипатьевна Вахрева", often gave him borscht to drink.
Even after the Chiang regime retreated to the warm Taiwan, he still maintained the habit of drinking borscht. Therefore, borscht is not only a delicacy, 
but also a cultural symbol, representing the warmth and reunion of the family. Below is a detailed introduction to borscht and how to make it.

Taiwan''s borscht is different from Eastern Europe. Taiwan does not produce beetroot, so Taiwan does not add this main vegetable to the recipe. Meat is traditionally treated with various spices in China, so my mother does the same. The meat processing is a fusion of traditional Chinese folk meat processing methods, coupled with the Italian mixed spices often used in European cuisine, which brings out the flavors of the soup and meat to different levels.


Ingredients and preparation of borscht soup

Here are the detailed ingredients and preparation steps for classic Ukrainian borscht:
Preparation:
1. Make meat stock:
 Put the meat into a large pot, cover with water (300~500cc) and bring to a boil. Skim off the scum on the surface and scoop it up.
 Add butter in a large soup pot and fry until golden brown and lightly charred.
 At the same time, add chopped onions and Chinese spices or braised buns, and simmer over low heat for about 1.5 hours until the meat becomes tender.
 (Key step) Place it in the refrigerator overnight to allow the flavor of the soup to penetrate into the meat, and to remove excess fat to make the soup taste more refreshing and not greasy.
1. Fried potatoes:
• Cut the diced potatoes into cubes and dry-fry them in a pot until golden brown and slightly charred to prevent them from being easily broken into the soup when simmering.
1. Mix ingredients:
• Pour the chopped tomatoes, potatoes, and carrots into the broth, simmer for 30 minutes, then add the cabbage.
 Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until the vegetables are soft, about 30 to 60 minutes.
1. Final seasoning:
• Add Italian spices for final seasoning.
1. Serve:
• Ladle the hot soup into bowls and sprinkle with fresh coriander and coriander. This portion follows tradition and is usually served with a slice of rye bread.
